# Population-App
 
This app lets users retrieve population information from a JSON file based on state, city, or zip code. I used JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and Handlebars to build all the functionality. To get started, run the server.js file! You just need to have node installed. The app will handle requests from the forms in the web app, query strings at the end of URLS, and API calls.
